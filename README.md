## 🎯 One Goal, Many Clouds: My Certification Path  

🎉 **New Certification Achieved: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)**  

I’m **Thomas Moses Moko**, and continued learning is my goal in life. Trying every major cloud platform is my target.  

On **June 20, 2025**, I proudly passed the **AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals** certification exam with a score of **842/1000**. This certification deepened my understanding of:  
- ☁️ **Cloud Concepts**  
- 🏗️ **Azure Architecture and Services**  
- 🛠️ **Azure Management and Governance**

🧠 I prepared for the exam using a combination of:
- **[Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/)** – where I took official training modules and completed hands-on labs.
- **[ABC of Cloud Computing](https://abcofcloud.com/)** – led by **Solomon Jeremiah**, a Microsoft MVP and Certified Trainer. His practical tutorials made Azure topics much easier to grasp.

📌 By completing key learning paths on Microsoft Learn, such as:
- *Introduction to Information Protection and Governance in Microsoft 365*  
- *Introduction to Information Security and Compliance in Microsoft Purview*  

🎁 I was able to earn a **100% free exam voucher** for the AZ-900 exam — and I’m proud to say I made the most of that opportunity!
